- Skin layers and their functions (graphics - skin layers, acid mantle)
The epidermis, the outermost layer of skin, provides a waterproof barrier and creates our skin tone.
The dermis, beneath the epidermis, contains tough connective tissue, hair follicles, and sweat glands.
The deeper subcutaneous tissue (hypodermis) is made of fat and connective tissue.
Skincare focuses on the epidermis and protecting the acid mantle.
The acid mantle is a thin, slightly acid layer on the surface of the skin that creates a barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants.
It is made up of sebum (free fatty acids) excreted from the skin's sebaceous glands, and when mixed with the acids from sweat, results in the skin's pH between 4.5-6.2.


- pH level: why it matters. PH of skin, PH of products
-- pH is a chemistry measurement of the acidity of a solution. It's measured in a scale from 0-14 where 0-6 is acidic, 7 is neutral, and 8-14 is basic (alkaline).
In chemistry terms, pH measures the concentration of free hydrogen ions present in a solution.
Solutions with a high concentration of free ions is considered acidic and solutions with a low concentration of free ions is considered basic.
So what does this mean for skincare? The skin's acid mantle is slightly acidic, with pH ranging between 4.5-6.2.
pH is highly sensitive to change, so you can disrupt your skin's natural pH (and therefore its ability to protect itself) by using products with a pH that is higher than the skin's pH.
Disrupting the acid mantle's natural pH can lead to skin issues such as dermatitis, eczema, and acne (bacterias thrive better in more basic environments).

The number one disrupter of the acid mantle are cleansers.
Cleansers, especially the ones that foam up nicely, tend to be more alkaline.
They strip away all oils from your face, leaving it feeling tight and "clean". In reality, they have destroyed your moisture barrier.

- Skin types and common concerns
-- Normal - not prone to oil or dryness
-- Oily - shiny all over, greasy
-- Dry - tight and or flaky
-- Combination - traits from all of the above

Skin concerns
- Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) -- dark spots, scars post inflammation
- Post inflammatory erythema (PIE) -- red/purpple spots post inflammation
- Dehydration -- feels tight, overly sensitive, over product oil to compensate
- Dryness -- rough, flaky, lacks oil
- Sensitivity -- skin reacts to harsh winds, scents, dirty pillowcases
- Aging -- maintaining skin as one gets older
- Skin tone -- maintaining a clear, even tone free from dark spots and blemishes
- Acne -- hormonal, bacterial, fungal.. pimples
- Blackheads -- oxidized oil + dirt
- Whiteheads

- UVA, UVB, and why SPF is not enough
-- UVA(long wave) and UVB(short wave)
- UVA rays account for 95% of UV radiation from the sun, less intense than UVB, but much more prevalent. They are present during all daylight hours and can penetrate through clouds and glass. This means that even if you're indoors, UVA rays can still reach you through glass windows.
- UVA penetrates the skin more deeply than UVB. This is the ray responsible for the "tanning glow", but also contributes to skin aging, wrinkling, and cancer.
- UVB rays cause skin reddening and sunburn, affecting the upper epidermal layers of skin. UVB rays are present during certain hours of the day and months of the year (10AM-4PM April-October in the US).
- Why is SPF not enough?
-- SPF stands for "sun protection factor" and it indicates how long it will take for UVB to redden your skin compared to no sunscreen at all. Using sunscreen at SPF 15 means your skin will take 15 times longer to burn than without sunscreen.
-- Historically, most Western sunscreens focused only on SPF and protecting against UVB rays. However, the usage was generally limited to sunny days by the pool and extended outdoor activity.
-- Most people come into contact with UVA rays on a daily basis and do not wear sunscreen.
-- Broad spectrum sunscreens are formulated to protect against both UVA and UVB rays, although most are still measured in SPF. The Japanese have put forth a PA rating (Protection Grade of UVA rays) to measure UVA protection.
-- Asian sunscreens will often be labeled with both SPF and PA. PA+ provides minimal protection, PA++ provides moderate protection, and PA+++ provides the highest.
-- Key ingredients to look for in broad spectrum sunscreens are zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, oxybenzone, avobenzone, and mexoryl.



- Types of products: cleansers, toners, sunscreen, (serums, essences, ampoules), lotion, exfoliants
- Types of Sunscreen: physical vs. chemical
- Types of moisturizers:
-- humectants: draw moisture from the atmosphere and lower layers of skin to give the upper layer more moisture. If used excessively, and especially in dry climates, this can draw out too much moisture from the lower levels of skin, thus worsening the dryness.
-- emollients: provides some occlusivity and fills in the cracks between dry skin cells, thus improving the appearance of smoother skin
-- occlusives: coat the skin and prevent "trans-epidermal" water loss. The downside is that they tend to leave a greasy feeling.
- Types of cleansers: oil, cream, foam
- Types of acids: BHA, AHA
- Types of boosters:

- Basic Routine: sunscreen, cleanse, moisturize, repeat
- Intermediate Routine: basic + acids (exfoliate)
- Expert Routine: Intermediate + serums, essences, ampoules


- Patch Testing
- Tips: oil cleansing, hydrocolloid bandages, haul responsibly

- 3 Things to NEVER DO
-- Baking soda exfoliation (Apricot Scrub): any kind of physical exfoliation with beads are too abrasive
-- Lemon juice exfoliation: Google "lemon juice chemical burn" images, followed by "cute puppies". You're welcome.
-- Pore strips: I know there is something very satisfying about seeing sebum on a pore strip, but in addition to not being very effective (they remove superficial sebum and dirt that will reappear in 24-48 hours), they can also run the risk of increasing pore size.
