- Skin layers and their functions (graphics - skin layers, acid mantle)
The epidermis, the outermost layer of skin, provides a waterproof barrier and creates our skin tone.
The dermis, beneath the epidermis, contains tough connective tissue, hair follicles, and sweat glands.
The deeper subcutaneous tissue (hypodermis) is made of fat and connective tissue.
Skincare focuses on the epidermis and protecting the acid mantle.
The acid mantle is a thin, slightly acid layer on the surface of the skin that creates a barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants.
It is made up of sebum (free fatty acids) excreted from the skin's sebaceous glands, and when mixed with the acids from sweat, results in the skin's pH between 4.5-6.2.


- pH level: why it matters. PH of skin, PH of products
-- pH is a chemistry measurement of the acidity of a solution. It's measured in a scale from 0-14 where 0-6 is acidic, 7 is neutral, and 8-14 is basic (alkaline).
In chemistry terms, pH measures the concentration of free hydrogen ions present in a solution.
Solutions with a high concentration of free ions is considered acidic and solutions with a low concentration of free ions is considered basic.
So what does this mean for skincare? The skin's acid mantle is slightly acidic, with pH ranging between 4.5-6.2.
pH is highly sensitive to change, so you can disrupt your skin's natural pH (and therefore its ability to protect itself) by using products with a pH that is higher than the skin's pH.
Disrupting the acid mantle's natural pH can lead to skin issues such as dermatitis, eczema, and acne (bacterias thrive better in more basic environments).

The number one disrupter of the acid mantle are cleansers.
Cleansers, especially the ones that foam up nicely, tend to be more alkaline.
They strip away all oils from your face, leaving it feeling tight and "clean". In reality, they have destroyed your moisture barrier.
