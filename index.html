        <hr class="section-heading-spacer"></hr>
        <p>I grew up in the era of ProActiv and St. Ives Apricot facial scrubs, and beauty blogs today still recommend lemon juice as a skin-brightener and baking soda as an exfoliant.</p>

          <h2>Layers of Skin</h2>
          <hr class="section-heading-spacer"></hr>
          <p>The epidermis, the outermost layer of skin, provides a waterproof barrier and creates our skin tone.</p>
          <p>The dermis, beneath the epidermis, contains tough connective tissue, hair follicles, and sweat glands.</p>
          <p>The deeper subcutaneous tissue (hypodermis) is made of fat and connective tissue.</p>
          <p>Skincare focuses on the epidermis and protecting the acid mantle.</p>
          <p>The acid mantle is a thin, slightly acid layer on the surface of the skin that creates a barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants.
          It is made up of sebum (free fatty acids) excreted from the skin's sebaceous glands, and when mixed with the acids from sweat, results in the skin's pH between 4.5-6.2.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="phlevel" class="spacer">
          <h2>pH: Why it Matters</h2>
          <hr class="section-heading-spacer"></hr>
          <p>pH is a chemistry measurement of the acidity of a solution. It's measured in a scale from 0-14 where 0-6 is acidic, 7 is neutral, and 8-14 is basic (alkaline).
          In chemistry terms, pH measures the concentration of free hydrogen ions present in a solution.
          Solutions with a high concentration of free ions is considered acidic and solutions with a low concentration of free ions is considered basic.</p>
          <p>So what does this mean for skincare? The skin's acid mantle is slightly acidic, with pH ranging between 4.5-6.2.</p>
          <p>pH is highly sensitive to change, so you can disrupt your skin's natural pH (and therefore its ability to protect itself) by using products with a pH that is higher than the skin's pH.</p>
          <p>Disrupting the acid mantle's natural pH can lead to skin issues such as dermatitis, eczema, and acne (bacterias thrive better in more basic environments).</p>
          <br>
          <p>The number one disrupter of the acid mantle are cleansers.
          Cleansers, especially the ones that foam up nicely, tend to be more alkaline.
          They strip away all oils from your face, leaving it feeling tight and "clean".</p>
          <p>In reality, they have destroyed your moisture barrier.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The pH level of skincare products directly affect the pH level of your skin. Avoid highly acidic and highly basic (lemon juice and baking soda are big no-no's) products.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="skintypes" class="spacer">
          <h2>Know Your Skin Type</h2>
          <hr class="section-heading-spacer"></hr>
          <p>The first step of assessing your skin type and needs will determine the types of products that are best suited for you.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Normal - not prone to oil or dryness</p>
          <br>
          <p>Oily - shiny all over, greasy</p>
          <br>
          <p>Dry - tight and or flaky</p>
          <br>
          <p>Combination - traits from all of the above</p>
          <br>
          <p>Most people may fall under the Combination type, where different parts of the face are prone to different types.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4 product-card">
              <h3>Cleanser</h3>
              <p>Cleansers remove oils, dirt, sunscreen, and makeup from your skin.</p>
              <p>Contrary to common opinion, your skin should not feel tight and dry after cleansing. This is a sign that the cleanser is too harsh.</p>
              <p>Popular types of cleansers include oil and foaming. Oil cleansing is popular for being gentle, yet effective at removing impurities without destroying the acid mantle.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 product-card">
              <h3>Moisturizer</h3>
              <p>If you cleanse, you must moisturize. Moisturizers replace any of the natural moisture (i.e. sebum) that have been washed away in the cleansing process.</p>
              <p>Moisturizers keep your skin hydrated, plump, and healthy.</p>
              <p>These products range from watery lotions (add hydration) to thick night creams (prevent moisture loss).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 product-card">
              <h3>Exfoliant</h3>
              <p>There are two types of exfoliants: physical and chemical.</p>
              <p>Physical exfoliants tend to be very harsh, and when used excessively, can damage your acid mantle and encourage acne. Physical exfoliation should be done sparingly, and with gentle products such as konjac sponges.</p>
              <p>Chemical exfoliants (aka: Acids) sounds scary, but are actually better for getting rid of dead skin, improving skin tone, fighting acne, and getting rid of closed comedones. The two primary types of acids used are AHA and BHA.</p>
              <p>Acids should be introduced to your skin gently, starting at a low percentage and no more than twice a week. At any signs of dryness or irritation, you may need to reduce the frequency and/or product strength.</p>

              <h3>Sunscreen</h3>
              <p>Sun exposure is one of the primary factors of skin aging, with results ranging from wrinkles to skin cancer.</p>
              <p>Sunscreen is not just for days at the beach; it should be a daily practice and part of any skincare routine.</p>
              <p>There are two primary types of sunscreen: physical and chemical. Physical sunscreens work by reflecting UV rays from your skin, while chemical sunscreens convert UV rays into heat that is released from the skin.</p>
              <p>Asian sunscreens tend to be better formulated for facial application compared to the heavier western Banana-Boat-type sunscreens.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 product-card">
              <h3>Serum, Essence, Ampoule</h3>
              <p>These products are for targeted skin issues like brightening, dark spots, or wrinkles.</p>
              <p>They often come in smaller packages with higher concentration of active ingredients such as Vitamin C and propolis.</p>
              <p>Traditionally, the differences between the three are often related to texture, although now serums have become thinner and essences have become thicker.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 product-card">
              <h3>Sheet Mask</h3>
              <p>These are the "gateway drug" to skincare, particularly Asian skincare.</p>
              <p>The one-time use cotton masks come soaked in a hydrating solution that is placed on your face.</p>
              <p>These are fun to use especially on long-haul flights because airplane air is especially drying, but don't offer that much function except for fun. Which I suppose is a function in itself.</p>

          <h2>Basic Routine</h2>
          <hr class="section-heading-spacer"></hr>
          <p>A basic routine has only 3 steps: sunscreen, cleanse, moisturize.</p>
          <p>This routine only focuses on sun protection. Once you've put on sunscreen, you'll need a way to remove it from your skin, which is where cleansing comes into play. And after cleansing, you'll need to moisturize.</p>
          <p>The simplicity of the basic routine is designed to protect your skin and your wallet. Introducing too many new products to your skin at once might cause some kind of reaction. There's also the high likelihood that you'll spend a good amount of money to "haul" everything, including products that are unsuited to your skin.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="spacer">
          <h2>Intermediate Routine</h2>
          <hr class="section-heading-spacer"></hr>
          <p>Once you've mastered the basic routine, you may choose to introduce exfoliants, either physical or chemical.</p>
          <p>Now the routine looks like: sunscreen, cleanse, exfoliant, moisturize</p>
          <p>When introducing acids into your routine, it is extremely important to patch test (see Resources below) and start off as gentle as possible: no more than twice a week with a lower concentration product. When you're certain that your skin can handle the exfoliant, you can increase the frequency of use.</p>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, when using an AHA it is ESPECIALLY important to use sunscreen.</p>
          <p>The efficiency of acids may be impacted by the pH levels of the skin they are applied to, so many people may also insert a pH balancing toner after the cleansing step to bring the skin back to a pH level that increases the efficiency of the acid.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="spacer">
          <h2>Advanced Routine</h2>
          <hr class="section-heading-spacer"></hr>
          <p>Once you've mastered the routines above, now you're ready to take your skincare to the next level with serums, ampoules, and essences to target specific skin concerns.</p>
          <p>There are products for just about any concern imaginable, from PIH to skin lightening to rosacea and of course, wrinkles!</p>
